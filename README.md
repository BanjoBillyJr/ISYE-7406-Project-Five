Air-BnB predictive Analysis.

Abstract
This analysis looks at Air BnB data in New York to find out which variables most impact Air
BnB rental Pricing. Variables include location factors like Borough, Longitude, Latitude, as
well as the type of rental, number of reviews, number of properties, and more. This
analysis includes exploratory data analysis that showcases the relationship between Air
BnB rental Pricing and each of these variables. This analysis also includes predictive
modeling that uses different data mining techniques to create a model that can predict Air
BnB rental prices with the lowest possible Error. This analysis is meant for three key
audiences: Renters, Hosts, and Air BnB Decision Makers. Predicting Prices will help
Renters know what fair price will be for their needs, will help Hosts know competitive
prices to charge, and help Air BnB know how to best connect Renters with the best host.

The Analysis includes the use of 10 fold cross validation on the following predictive models and a analysis of the effect different tuning parameters has on each model's performance: 
- KNN
- Descicion Tree
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Grandiant Boosting
- XG Boosting
